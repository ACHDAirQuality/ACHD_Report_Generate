\newcommand\Discriptions{*** Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Friday:Quite a comfortable Friday is underway with temperatures climbing through the 70s early this afternoon with low humidity levels.Chances for some light precipitation return this weekend before hot and drier conditions arrive for the start of next week.*** Saturday's Forecast:A disturbance approaching the region will bring a mix of sun and clouds along with a chance for some scattered light showers on Saturday.Highs will reach the mid-70s with a southerly breeze.Ozone formation will be limited with the clouds and scattered showers to keep concentrations inside the good range.Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) will also remain inside the good range.*** Sunday's Forecast:Another disturbance passing through the region on Sunday will trigger a higher chance for scattered showers and a few thunderstorms.Skies will be mostly cloudy to limit ozone formation so concentrations will remain inside the good range.A southwesterly breeze will bring more moisture into the area than what was available on Saturday so these showers may be heavier at times.With the increase in moisture and southwesterly winds, PM-2.5 concentrations will climb to the higher end of the good range, but any shower and thunderstorm activity will limit any further climb than that.Temperatures will approach the upper 70s because of the southwesterly flow.}
