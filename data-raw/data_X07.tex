\newcommand\Discriptions{*** Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Thursday:Hot and humid conditions continue today but relief is on the way.A cold front will bring showers and thunderstorms through the region this evening with cooler, drier, and cleaner air arriving for the weekend.*** Friday's Forecast:After two very humid days dew point temperatures will fall over the course of the day on Friday as a drier air mass moves in behind the cold front from late Thursday.Temperatures will still be seasonable with highs much more comfortably in the mid-80s.The air mass with the elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) from the last two days will move off to the south and east with conditions improving throughout the day.Concentrations may still be at moderate levels for the start of the early morning hours, but will average out to be in the good range as the cleaner air mass moves in.Brisk northwesterly flow will also help to provide plenty of mixing to help limit not only PM-2.5 but also ozone concentrations to result in good air quality overall for the day.}
