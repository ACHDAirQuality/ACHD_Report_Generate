\newcommand\Discriptions{Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Friday:One wave of showers and thunderstorms are developing and pushing eastward well off to our east and a second wave is now developing to the west through eastern Ohio ahead of a slow-moving cold front this afternoon.Good air quality continues once again today though a change in the pattern may end the streak of good air quality days late this weekend.*** Saturday's Forecast:A slow moving cold front will push to the east on Saturday.Lingering showers are possible during the early morning hours prior to the frontal passage.Mostly cloudy skies to start the- morning hours will give way to increasing sunshine by the afternoon.Even with some afternoon sun, ozone concentrations will remain at levels inside the good range.Breezy westerly flow behind the front will help to keep concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) inside the good range as well.Highs will reach the low to mid-70s.}
