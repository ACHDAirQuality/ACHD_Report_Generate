\newcommand\Discriptions{Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Thursday:Temperatures are surging well into the 70s this afternoon with several locations now reaching the low-80s under mostly cloudy skies.It has been a good week so far air quality wise and today is no different.Unsettled weather arriving tonight will continue the streak of good air quality into the start of the holiday weekend, though conditions may change late weekend with hotter and drier weather.*** Friday's Forecast:A low pressure system approaching from the west will continue provide showers and thunderstorms across the region on Friday.Highest chances for rainfall will be early in the day.Breezy southerly flow will continue to usher in ample moisture so some of these showers may result in periods of heavier rainfall.Mostly cloudy skies throughout the remainder of the day will limit ozone concentrations to the good range.The breezy winds and early rainfall will also keep concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) inside the good range.Highs will be in the low to mid-70s.}
