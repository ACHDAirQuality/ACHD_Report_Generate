\newcommand\Discriptions{Clouds will start the day Saturday, then some sunshine appears Saturday afternoon. A shower or thunderstorm may also affect the area late in the day and during the evening. Ozone will be restricted to the good range in most locations, but increasing humidity will elevate PM2.5 to the moderate range. *** Sunday's forecast: Sunday will bring mostly cloudy skies as an area of low pressure moves southeastward out of the Great Lakes, with showers and thunderstorms likely. Increasing mixing and rainfall will result in air quality improving to the good range. *** Monday's forecast: Unsettled weather will continue Monday with another round of showers and thunderstorms. Low level mixing as well as cloud cover and rainfall will again result in low levels of ozone and PM2.5. }
