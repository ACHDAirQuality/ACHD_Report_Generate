\newcommand\Discriptions{*** Current Conditions as of 1 PM on Monday:A warm Monday is underway with temperatures already into the low to mid-80s with more humidity than we have seen the last few days.A week of hot and unsettled weather is on the way with highs in the 80s and 90s with daily chances for showers and thunderstorms.*** Tuesday's Forecast:What is left of a convective system that will bring heavy thunderstorms to the Great Lakes region Monday night will approach the east coast Tuesday morning.That system will bring cloud cover and scattered early morning showers.Clearing skies during the afternoon will allow temperatures to quickly climb into the upper 80s.Ozone formation will be limited early, but concentrations will rise along with the temperature in the afternoon to approach the moderate range.The morning showers will help limit concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) as well, but light westerly flow for the remainder of the day will allow concentrations to approach the moderate range as well.}
