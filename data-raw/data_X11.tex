\newcommand\Discriptions{Sunshine will fade behind mid and high level clouds by the end of Saturday, but with enough strong sun to push ozone maximums into the moderate range. Fine particulate concentrations may also move into the moderate zone as well with only fair dispersion expected. *** Sundayâs forecast: Ozone will be in the good range Sunday as an area of low pressure kicks off showers and a stronger thunderstorm in the afternoon and evening. Increased mixing, rainfall and a southeast wind will mean PM2.5 averages in the good range. *** Mondayâs forecast: The sun returns Monday with a seasonably mild afternoon. PM2.5 may be elevated Monday morning, but a brisk west to southwest wind should mean average levels of this pollutant are no worse than moderate. In addition, the sunshine might send ozone levels to moderate during the afternoon.}
