\newcommand\Discriptions{*** Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Wednesday:A warm front pushing eastward this morning sent dew point temperatures surging into the 70s.Temperatures this afternoon are into the upper 80s to low 90s with very humid conditions.There is a little bit of haze in the sky due to some wildfire smoke aloft, but it is contributing very little to ground level air quality.Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) have been rising behind the warm front due to some influence of Saharan dust that has impacted air quality along the Gulf Coast and northward earlier this week.*** Thursday's Forecast:Hot and humid conditions will continue Thursday, though relief is on the way.Scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop Thursday afternoon ahead of an approaching cold front.Temperatures will again approach the low 90s on Thursday which will help to develop some stronger afternoon storms.PM-2.5 concentrations will continue to be elevated at levels well into the moderate range for the day.Breezy southwesterly flow and afternoon precipitation will provide just enough mixing that these concentrations are not expected to average out above the moderate range for the day.Ozone concentrations will be limited with the afternoon shower and thunderstorm development to the higher end of the good range.}
