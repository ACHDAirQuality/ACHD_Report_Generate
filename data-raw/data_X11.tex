\newcommand\Discriptions{Periods of clouds and sunshine Saturday. A weakening upper level low nearby will result in the development of showers and a thunderstorm, mainly during the afternoon and evening. PM2.5 will again be highest in the morning, but a south to southeast breeze will maintain overall daily average in the upper good range. Ozone will also remain in the good range with the cloud cover and potential rainfall. *** Sunday's forecast: Times of clouds and sunshine Sunday, and there canstill be a morning shower in parts of the area. The increase in sunshine will cause ozone to go into the moderate range, and while PM2.5 may be moderate for a time Sunday morning, better afternoon dispersion allows concentrations of this pollutant to decrease during the afternoon. *** Monday's forecast: Not as warm Monday as showers and thunderstorms will accompany the passage of a cold front. Air quality will return to the good range with clouds and cooler air.}
