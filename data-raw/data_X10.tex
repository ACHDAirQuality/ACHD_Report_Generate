\newcommand\Discriptions{Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Wednesday:Temperatures are climbing into the 70s this afternoon as under a mix of sun and clouds.Good air quality continues today with concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) remaining at levels inside the good range.*** Thursday's Forecast:The southeasterly flow from Wednesday will become more southerly on Thursday.This will be as the area of high pressure to our north shifts more eastward and attention turns to the storm system currently over the central part of the country as it progresses eastward.Increasing moisture will allow for dew point temperatures to rise to more humid levels over the course of the day on Thursday.Chances for precipitation will be limited early in the day with higher probabilities late afternoon through the overnight hours Thursday night.With increasing cloud cover, ozone formation will be tough to come by with concentrations staying inside the good range.PM-2.5 concentrations are expected to climb to levels higher than the past few days but will also be limited to the higher end of the good range.Highs will be in the low 80s.}
