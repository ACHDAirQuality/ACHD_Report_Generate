\newcommand\Discriptions{Current Conditions as of 2 PM on Friday:Mostly sunny skies from early this morning have become increasingly cloudy this afternoon as the next wave of April showers approaches.Unsettled weather will allow for a continuation of good air quality conditions well into the weekend.*** Saturdayâs Forecast:Showers will be scattered to isolated about the region for Saturday, but early cloud cover and breezy westerly flow will hold highs only to the mid-40s for the day.Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM-2.5) will remain at levels well inside the good range.*** Sundayâs Forecast:Brisk northwesterly flow will usher drier and still unseasonably cool air into the region for Sunday.The system responsible for the unsettled conditions Friday and Saturday will be departing the region with high pressure starting to build.More sunshine is expected on Sunday with the drier conditions compared to Saturday.As a result, temperatures will fare slightly better with highs reaching the low-50s.With the brisk wind, the air mass will continue to be well mixed resulting in another day of good air quality.}
